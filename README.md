### From Damian Conway’s “More Instantly Better Vim”

This is simply a repo to host this code in a way that's friendlier to vim plugin managers such as [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle), and [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim).

[See the whole talk](http://programming.oreilly.com/2013/10/more-instantly-better-vim.html), or [jump to the specific part](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHm36-na4-4#t=12m01s) that explains what this does.
